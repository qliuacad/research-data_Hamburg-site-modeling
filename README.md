there are 4 documents:
1) gelogical.csv: the hydrostratigraphic information for stratigraphic delineation.
2) ground temperature profiles.xlsx: the undistributed temperature profile and the ground temperature profile measuements and simulations during the BHE system operation.
3) groundwater temperature.csv: the measured and simulated groundwater temperature at multiple depths in the groundwater wells of GW1 and GW2.
4) monitored data 2018-2022.csv: the heat loads for the two BHE subfields including the thermal power and flow rate of the heat-carrying fluid.
